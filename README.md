# grblPANEL 3D printed enclosure

A simple 3D printed back box for the reference front panel.

Uses a 100mm VESA hole pattern for mounting at the rear, and heat-set M4 brass inserts for the panel securing screws.

Sized to fit on a typical 3D printer (intial versions were printed
on a Ender3 v2). 

*todo: add strengthening ribs, resize cable entry for GX12 connector*
